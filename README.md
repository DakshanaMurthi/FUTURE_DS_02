📊 Social Media Campaign Performance Tracker
FUTURE_DS_02 – Data Science & Analytics Internship (Task 2)

This repository contains the complete work for Task 2 of the Future Interns – Data Science & Analytics Track, where the goal is to analyze ad campaign performance and build a data-driven dashboard.

📁 Project Overview

In this task, we analyze Facebook/Instagram ad campaign data to understand:

How well the campaign performed

Which age/gender groups responded best

CTR (Click-Through Rate)

CPC (Cost per Click)

CPA (Cost per Approved Conversion)

Engagement & spend patterns

Using this analysis, an interactive dashboard is created to help marketers make decisions and optimize future campaigns.

🧹 Data Cleaning Performed

✔ Removed invalid values
✔ Fixed mixed gender values (only M/F retained, others blank)
✔ Converted dates (reporting_start, reporting_end)
✔ Removed rows with missing impressions & clicks
✔ Handled zeros in spent, clicks, conversions
✔ Cleaned fb_campaign_id and campaign_id
✔ Created calculated metrics:

CTR = Clicks / Impressions

CPC = Spent / Clicks

CPA = Spent / Approved Conversions
